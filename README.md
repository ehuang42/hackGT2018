## Inspiration
We wanted to use AI to create something fun and simple, but also **unique** and **expressive**.

## What it does
The web app uses Google Cloud Vision API to recognize the dominant colors of an image captured from a webcam. It then suggests a playlist from Spotify using the color scheme as well as display the three main colors of the image with their hex values.  

## Challenges we ran into
We had trouble trying to implement Spotify, we had tried using their API and SDK but there was no easy way to use it the way we desired. 

## What we learned
We learned lots of things about javascript, html, css, and the google vision API. As CS majors, we certainly learned more about color theory and color psychology for the expressive part of the project.

## What's next for coloru.
In the future, we would like to add image _**uploading functionality**_. By enabling drag and drop, we can give users a wider range of mood to choose from! Also, we would want to more complex analysis of the _**color scheme**_ for the relevant playlist. For example, all black/dark palette triggers a death metal playlist, whereas black as dominant and some other highlight colors can be a city light playlist. Finally, we would like to incorporate more  _**AI powered API**_. We might utilize association words API to help us randomized a search within a mood range. For instance, grey could be peace, chill, alone, etc. Using these word pools as foundation, we can generate countless search keywords base on association analysis.
